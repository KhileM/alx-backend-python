In Python, an asynchronous function, commonly referred to as an async function, is a function that can be paused and resumed during its execution, allowing other tasks to run in the meantime. Async functions are a key component of the asynchronous programming model, particularly in the context of asynchronous I/O operations, concurrent programming, and event-driven architectures.

Async functions are defined using the `async` keyword before the `def` keyword. Inside an async function, you can use the `await` keyword to pause the execution of the function until a certain asynchronous operation (such as I/O operation or another async function) is completed.

Here's a simple example of an async function:

```python
import asyncio

async def async_example():
    print("Start of async function")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate an asynchronous operation (sleep for 2 seconds)
    print("End of async function")

# To run an async function, you typically use an event loop:
asyncio.run(async_example())
```

In this example, when `async_example()` is called, it prints a message, then uses `await asyncio.sleep(2)` to pause the function for 2 seconds without blocking the entire program. During this time, other tasks or functions can be executed. After the sleep is completed, the function resumes and prints another message.

Async functions are particularly useful in scenarios where you want to perform multiple tasks concurrently without waiting for each task to complete before moving on to the next one. This asynchronous programming style can lead to more efficient and responsive applications, especially in situations with I/O-bound operations.
